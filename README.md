# Camera Calibration

Camera calibration is the process of determining specific camera parameters in order to complete operations with specified performance measurements.
Camera calibration can be defined as the technique of estimating the characteristics of a camera. It means that we have all of the cameraâ€™s information like parameters or coefficients which are needed to determine an accurate relationship between a 3D point in the real world and its corresponding 2D projection in the image acquired by that calibrated camera.
